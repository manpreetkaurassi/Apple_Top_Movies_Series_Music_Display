# Apple_Top_Movies_Series_Music_Display

Android application built using Android Studio which reads RSS(summarised) data from apple RSS fees and displays it on the screen. The menu options include - top 10 movies, top 10 series and top songs.

Applied multithreading using Async functionality of Android.

Created a custon adapter to be able to customise the look on the screen

App is efficient in terms of memory utilisation. When you scroll down, it reuses the views prior created. This also saves cost and time.
